## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->




### Team Agreement 


 ### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate? 3pm to 9pm EST for Anthony, 12pm to 6pm PST For Michelle.   
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack for both   
How often will you take breaks? As needed.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? By leveraging Anthony's tenacity and Michele's Attention to detail, we can focus on the task at hand. 
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Anthony says he needs a better understanding of coding in general, which will come from just doing more coding. Michelle  says she needs more effort for collaboration.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Michelle's plan is to read through every detail and do things one at at time. Anthony's plan is to discuss what we are each doing, ensuring team cohesion. 

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? Discuss it and let them know, go for an open forum between partners. 
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?  Ask for equal collaboration, and express one's feelings about how the team is working together. 
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? Discuss plan for the day, ensure each partner is working on a SEPERATE task on their own branch, so we can prevent conflicting code.
